# Personal Budget
This project contains a Python script that simulates realistic personal financial activity over a one-year period. The generator produces a synthetic dataset of 500 weekly transactions based on salary-driven category budgets, allowing users to analyze spending behavior, income patterns, and savings tendencies.
